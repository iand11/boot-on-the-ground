  <div class="carousel ">
    <p class="testimonialText slides">"To me, it wasn't about the coding. The difference between online learning and this experience was the power of community. When I fell down, I saw others fall down too, but they got up. They admitted mistakes, fixed them, and kept moving. So I got up. I kept moving. "</p>
    <p class="testimonialText slides">"Never have I ever been a part of such a quirky, magical, and passion-driven team. From our inside jokes to the amazing events we've hosted. You all made my "Dream Job" possible. Moreover, I'm proud of the person I've become as a result of working with this team. Being a part of the Careers Team changed my life."</p>
    <p class="testimonialText slides">"Dev Bootcamp literally changed my life. I love what I do now, in the cliche "Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life" kind of way. And what I learned about Emotional Intelligence has benefited me in literally every aspect of my life."</p>
    <p class="testimonialText slides">"This place meant so much to me as both a student as well as when I came back and helped teach. But I am now realizing it was never the place, it was always the people - DBC is whatever the opposite of 'haunted' is - students and staff that passed through left a bit of themselves behind"</p>
